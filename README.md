Netflix Data Analysis
Code Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Netflix data using Python. The code, structured in a Jupyter Notebook format, dives deep into understanding various aspects of the Netflix dataset, including content availability, genre popularity, trends over time, and sentiment analysis.

Code Structure
The Jupyter Notebook ('Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb') is organized into distinct sections:

1. Libraries Used
Importing necessary Python libraries essential for data manipulation, visualization, and sentiment analysis.

2. Data Loading and Pre-processing
Loading the 'netflix_titles.csv' dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Basic dataset exploration including shape, columns, duplicates, and missing/null values.
Handling missing data by replacing null values in columns such as 'director', 'cast', and 'country'.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing missing/null values using heat maps to identify patterns.
Extracting temporal information from the 'date_added' column.
Generating insights into the trend of content produced over the years using line plots.
4. Visualizations and Insights
Creating informative visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and word clouds to explore genre distributions and sentiment analysis.
**Conducting sentiment analysis on content descriptions using the TextBlob library.**
Libraries Used
The analysis harnesses the power of several Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations.
Plotly Express: For interactive and visually appealing plots.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.
**TextBlob: For sentiment analysis on textual data.**
Data Generation
The analysis primarily revolves around the 'netflix_titles.csv' dataset.The dataset is sourced from personal Netflix data and is stored in a .csv file format.

Data Analysis
The analysis covers an extensive range of topics:

Comprehensive data cleaning including handling duplicates and null values.
In-depth exploration of content trends over the years.
Visualization of genre distributions through pie charts and word clouds.
Evaluation of sentiment towards content descriptions.
Code Files
Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis code.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (preferably Python 3.7.9) installed on your machine.

Libraries Installation
Use the following commands in your terminal or command prompt to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob

Running the Code
To replicate the analysis:

Download the 'netflix_titles.csv' dataset or provide the correct file path.
Open the 'Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook file in your Python environment.
Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis step-by-step.

Results
The analysis generates various visualizations, offering valuable insights into Netflix data, including genre distributions, content trends over time etc.
